    <h1>Kata: Do I Get A Bonus</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in
      anticipation...<br />
      but who is going to make the most money?<br />
      <br />
      Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will
      be an integer, <br />
      and bonus a boolean. <br />
      <br />
      If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is
      false, the fatcat<br />
      did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.<br />
      <br />
      Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed
      <br />
      with "£" (= "\u00A3", JS, Go, Java and Julia), "$" (C#, C++, Ruby,
      Clojure, <br />
      Elixir, PHP, Python, Haskell and Lua) or "¥" (Rust).<br />
